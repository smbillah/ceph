v0.80.10
~~~~~~~~
If rgw_socket_path is defined and rgw_frontends defines a socket_port and socket_host,
we now allow the rgw_frontends settings to take precedence. This change should only
affect users who have made non-standard changes to their radosgw configuration
.

v9.0.1
~~~~~~

- 'ceph scrub', 'ceph compact' and 'ceph sync force are now DEPRECATED.  Users
  should instead use 'ceph mon scrub', 'ceph mon compact' and
  'ceph mon sync force'.
